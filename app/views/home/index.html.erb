    <p>Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, 
	in a nod to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code kata is an exercise in 
	programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.</p>
    <p>The goal of this Kata is to get your mind wired into performance driven development, 
	to reinforce your skills as a user of <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> 
        and to help you get more familiar with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
    <p>Of course the code in some areas of this application is intentionally bad, but what fun would this 
	be if everything worked the way it should?</p>

      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>Get the code. Using your <a href="http://github.com">github</a> account, fork
	the <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-kata">newrelic/newrelic-ruby-kata</a> repo
	and then clone it onto your machine.</p>

    <div class="span4">
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>Create a Heroku app. Using your <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a> account, create
	a new app and then push the kata code to it. 
	(Use the <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/">Heroku toolbelt</a>.)</p>
    <pre>heroku apps:create
git push heroku master</pre>
